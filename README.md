This little project ships with Gatsby configuration is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator camouflaged as a modern front-end framework.

Using Gatsby is because it is fully extensible. Complimenting headless CMS like Headless WordPress and Grav, it can be used with any static site generator to construct a faster and flexible web app.
